Hello and welcome to STF

I am the Author, Shanvanth Arunmozhi

I created .STF mostly for people to format text. Because Most of the text formating file formats were either too advanced or too basic
Basic - text file, rich text, Markdown etc...
Advanced - Word Doc, Adobe Pdf etc...
So I created a new File type .STF for moderate text formating

All the rules and examples you need for learning are there in :- "Declaration, Rules and Examples of STF files.stf"

Thank you for using .STF files
